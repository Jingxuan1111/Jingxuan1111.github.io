# **Biography**
### I am currently a master student in Biomolecular-material Interface group, department of Materials Science & Engineering, University of California. My advisor is [Prof.Yuhuang](http://yhuang.seas.ucla.edu/Research/). I received my B.Eng.Degree from Xian Jiao Tong University (XJTU), under the supervision of [Prof.Hongjie Wang](http://mse-en.xjtu.edu.cn/en/people_show.php?id=4388) and a B.Sci.Degree of Economics as the second major.

# **Field of interest**
### Energy storage & conversion materials; 2D materials; Nanomaterials

# **Motto**
### Never elaborate a baroque excrescence on top of existing but shaky ideas.Go right to the foundations and test the implicit but unexamined assumptions of an important body of work, or lay the foundations for a new research thrust.

# **Experimental Skills**
### Experienced user of FEI (T12-TEM); XRD ; SEM
### Master the ICP-MS , ORR and HER testing of catalysts.
### Manage to do the Hydrothermal synthesis of 2D materials and Biomimetic synthesis of Pt-nanowire.
### Master the use of peptide synthesizer (CSBIO).
### Master the electrochemical intercalation and exfoliation of TMDs materials

# **Projects**
## Undergraduate thesis
### **Construction of MoS2/SiC nanowire composites and electrocatalyst**
#### Hydrothermal synthesize the composite and obtain catalysts with good HER properties through optimizing the ratio of contents of the composite
#### The research essay Emerging 1D/2D hybrid nanocomposites of SiC nanowires wrapped with MoS2 nanosheets as an efficient electrocatalyst has been recently submitted to the Journal of Materials Chemistry A.(Second Author)

## Finished work
### **Biomimetic synthesis of Ultrathin Pt nanowires by peptide-BP7A** 
#### The Pt-nanowire supposed to show high ECSA and SA for ORR testing.The manuscript of this work is waiting for submission(Second Author)

### **Proton exchange membrane fuel cell** 
#### Creating a favorable microenvironment at the ionomer-support interface for high performance ORR in PEMFC.The manuscript is waiting for submission( one of the co-authors)

## Possible graduate thesis topic
### **The synthesis and self-assembling of Pt nanoparticles driven by peptides**
#### Apply Al and peptide-T7(T-L-T-T-L-T-A) to obtain 1D assembling.The 3D assembling is accomplished by Al and peptide-S7(S-S-P-P-G-P-A)

### **TMDs aerogel**
#### Design a freeze-drying process for the exfoliated TMDs to form a semiconducting aerogel, which may have promising optical or mechanical properties

### **Vertical stacking of TMDs flakes**
#### Applying strong binding peptide (specifically selected by phage library) to enhance the van de waals binding force between the TMDs flakes

# **Selected Honours**
### Second prize, the 11th Challenge Cup Shaanxi Undergraduated Curricular Academic Science & Technology works
### Second prize, the 10th China College Students' Entrepreneurship Competition
### Outstanding Project of the 1st and 2nd XJTU Youth Leadership Project
### Recognition Award of Microsoft Imagine Cup (China)
